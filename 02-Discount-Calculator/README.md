# 🏷️ Discount Calculator

A simple C program that calculates the final price of a product after applying a 15% discount.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates fundamental C programming concepts:
* **Defining constants**: Using the `#define` preprocessor directive.
* **Data types**: Working with floating-point numbers (`float`) for financial calculations.
* **Type Casting**: Converting a `float` price to an `integer` (`int`) to get the whole number part.
* **Output Formatting**: Using `printf` to display currency with 2 decimal places (`%.2f`).

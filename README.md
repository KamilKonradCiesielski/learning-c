# 📚 Learning C & Embedded Systems

Welcome to my journey of learning the C programming language and electronics with Arduino. This repository contains my exercises, small projects, and hardware experiments.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** C (GCC Compiler)
* **Hardware:** Arduino Nano / Uno
* **Simulators:** CRUMB Circuit Simulator

## 📁 Projects Directory

Each folder contains its own source code and a detailed README.

1. [Casting Example](./01_Casting_Example) - Basics of data types and type casting.
2. [Discount Calculator](./02_Discount_Calculator) - A simple financial tool practicing preprocessor directives.
3. [Arduino Piano](./03_Arduino_Piano) - An interactive project using a buzzer and buttons (Tested in CRUMB).
4. [Double LED Blink](./04_Double_Blink) - Alternating LED blink sequence using digital outputs.
5. [Solar Logic Analyzer](./05_Solar_Energy_Logic) - Boolean expressions and operator precedence for environmental monitoring.

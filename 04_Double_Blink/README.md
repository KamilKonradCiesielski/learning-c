# 💡 Double LED Blink

A simple Arduino project that alternates between two LEDs, creating a basic "railroad crossing" or "emergency lights" effect.

## 🚀 How it works
The program uses two digital pins (2 and 3) as outputs. It turns the first LED on for 1 second, then switches to the second one for another second in an infinite loop.

## 📋 Pin Configuration
* **Pin 2**: Red LED (connected via resistor)
* **Pin 3**: Green/Blue LED (connected via resistor)
